# jna-capture-experiment
Experimental code to not be reviewed or looked at!

* This repository contains experimentation code to create a coloured overlay on the desktop. 
* To screen record a specific process.

The experiments goal is to be able to capture a process and then to...
1. Overlay a coloured tint
2. Add image affects such as saturation 
3. Replace colours e.g. turning green into pink
4. If successful, allowing different user blindness modes (e.g. tritanopia, deuteranopia, and protanopia)

Project heavily relies on native system calls and only supports Windows due that nature.
